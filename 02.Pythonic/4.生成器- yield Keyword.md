# 生成器 generator

- 生成器只执行生成操作，不执行行为操作,行为操作在外部执行；即只生成所需要的变量，不对变量进行额外的行为操作

- 生成器内部不保留任何数据，只保留生成所需数据的算法，所以不会占用内存
  
- 优势 ：既保证了函数独立性，又解决了性能问题

- 生成器 **yield** 接着上次返回的地方，继续执行代码；普通函数 **return**，返回结果并结束

```python
# 打印 0 ~ 10000

# 生成器在列表推导式中的应用 --- 缺点，太占内存
# n = （i for i in range(0, 10001))
# print(n) # <generator object <genexpr> at 0x000001580D40C148>
def gen(max):
    n = 0
    while n <= max:
        n += 1
        yield n     # return n --- 返回 n 并结束 while
                    # yield n ---- 返回 n, 之后返回代码内部，继续执行 while 代码

g = gen(100000)

# 每执行一次 next，得到下一个变量
print(next(g))
print(next(g))
print(next(g))

# 生成器可以被遍历
for i in g:
    print(i)
```

# yield Keyword

yield is a keyword in Python that is used to return from a function without destroying the states of its local variable and when the function is called, the execution starts from the last yield statement. 

Any function that contains a yield keyword is **termed as generator**. 

Hence, yield is what makes a generator. yield keyword in Python is less known off but has a greater utility which one can think of.

```python
# Code-1 : Demonstrating yield working
# Python3 code to demonstrate 
# yield keyword 

# generator to print even numbers 
def print_even(test_list) : 
	for i in test_list: 
		if i % 2 == 0: 
			yield i 

# initializing list 
test_list = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7] 

# printing initial list 
print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list)) 

# printing even numbers 
print ("The even numbers in list are : ", end = " ") 
for j in print_even(test_list): 
	print (j, end = " ") 
````

```
output:

The original list is : [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]
The even numbers in list are :  4 6 
```

```python
# Code-2:

# A Python program to generate squares from 1  
# to 100 using yield and therefore generator  
  
# An infinite generator function that prints  
# next square number. It starts with 1  
def nextSquare():  
    i = 1;  
  
    # An Infinite loop to generate squares  
    while True:  
        yield i*i                  
        i += 1 # Next execution resumes  
                # from this point      
  
# Driver code  
for num in nextSquare():  
    if num > 100:  
        break    
    print(num)  
```

```
output:

1
4
9
16
25
36
49
64
81
100
```

### Advantages of yield:

- Since it stores the local variable states, hence overhead of memory allocation is controlled.

- Since the old state is retained, flow doesn’t start from the beginnning and hence saves time.

### Disadvantages of yield:

- Sometimes, the use of yield becomes erroneous is calling of function is not handled properly.

- The time and memory optimization has a cost of complexity of code and hence sometimes hard to understand logic behind it.

### Practical Applications:

The possible practical application is that when handling the last amount of data and searching particulars from it, yield can be used as we don’t need to lookup again from start and hence would save time. There can possibly be many application of yield depending upon the use cases.

```python
# Python3 code to demonstrate yield keyword 
  
# Checking number of occurrence of  
# geeks in string  
  
# generator to print even numbers 
def print_even(test_string) : 
    for i in test_string: 
        if i == "geeks": 
            yield i 
  
# initializing string 
test_string = " The are many geeks around you, \ 
              geeks are known for teaching other geeks" 
  
# printing even numbers using yield 
count = 0
print ("The number of geeks in string is : ", end = "" ) 
test_string = test_string.split() 
  
for j in print_even(test_string): 
    count = count + 1
  
print (count) 
```

```
output:

The number of geeks in string is : 3
